;Head 1 is the head which reaches the inspection piece first when the carriage is

;Head 2 is the second head to reach the piece, and so on.
;
;The front edge of the head is the edge which reaches the inspection piece first
;when the carriage is moving away from the operator's station (the "forward" direction).
;
;When each transducer has its own trace, the "Offset Distance" for each trace is the
;distance from each transducer to the front edge of the head -- a positive number.
;
;When several transducers are merged into a single trace, the "offset distance" will
;usually be from the front edge to the center of the group.
;
; All transducer to head edge distances are positive values of inch units.

;Photo Eye 1 is the photo eye which reaches the inspection piece first when the carriage

;This distance is to the target point of the photo eye's beam, not the photo eye itself.
;This is important when the eye is angled such that the beam strikes at a point other
;than directly below the eye.

; All photo eye to head distances are positive values of inch units.
