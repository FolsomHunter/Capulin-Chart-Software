The coefficient scaling value is multiplied by each coefficient to change the filter gain. Usually, it is <= 1 to use or reduce the gain inherent in the filter. Generally, it is best to leave this value at 1 and reduce the gain by increasing the FIR filter right shift value (more negative).

FIR filter shift is applied to the output of each convolution. It is typically negative to scale the output down. FIR filter shift range: -16 ~ +15

The "preprocessing mode" value specifies the type of processing to be applied to each raw sample before it is run through the digital filter:

	0: no processing
	1: absolute value
