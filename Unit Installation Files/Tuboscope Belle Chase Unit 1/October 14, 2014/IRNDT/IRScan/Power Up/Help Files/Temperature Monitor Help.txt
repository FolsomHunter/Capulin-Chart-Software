Capulin UT Systems with DAQ Network Temperature Monitors


DAQ Temperature Module and WebRelay Module

The system uses a DAQ Temperature Module to monitor the
temperature in the chassis.  It uses a WebRelay Module to
signal the PLC that the temperature is safe and that it
is okay to power the chassis.

If the Chassis Power Switch on the PLC is ON, the Chassis
Power Breaker is on, and the Temperature Safe Signal is
received, the PLC will power the chassis.

The Temperature Safe Signal is a pulse -- if it does not
occur approximately once per minute or stays in the active
state for more than 2 seconds, the PLC assumes the
temperature is unsafe or the monitor program is not
operating and will shut off the chassis power.


-- To Set Up DAQ Temperature Module --

If the WebRelay Module has not already been set up then 
disconnect it from the network or it will conflict with the
DAQ Temperature Module during setup as they initially have
the same IP address.

Set computer TCP/IPv4 address to: 192.168.1.50
Set netmask to: 255.255.255.0

In web browser, go to address: http://192.168.1.2/setup.html

The username is admin, password is webrelay.

On the "Sensor 1" tab, select the sensor from the 
"Sensor Address" dropdown.

On the "Network" tab, change settings to:

IP Address: 169.254.1.2
Netmask: 255.255.0.0
Broadcast: 169.254.1.255
Gateway: 169.254.1.1
TCP Port: 80
Modbus Port: 502
Speed: 10Mbps
MOde: Half Duplex

NOTE: do not change tabs before clicking "Submit" or all
 values will be reset.

After setting up addresses as described above:

Reset the computers LAN network adapter to "Obtain an IP
 address automatically".
