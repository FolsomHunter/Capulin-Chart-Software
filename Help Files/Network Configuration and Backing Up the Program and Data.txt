Networking Configuration

The ethernet port connected to the electronics chassis must be configured as follows:

Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)

	Obtain an IP address automatically

	Obtain DNS server address automatically


If the computer is to be connected to the Internet or a local network system at the same time, another Ethernet port must be installed. Typically, a USB-Ethernet port is used to connect to the UT chassis in that case.

Backup Up the IRScan program and/or Inspection Data Files


My Documents
  IRNDT
    IR Scan Data Files -  Primary
    IR Scan Data Files - Backup
    IRScan


For a simple setup, the IRScan program and data file folders are all stored together in a single folder (IRNDT) in My Documents.

If the IRNDT folder is copied to a backup, the current program and all inspection data will be backed up.

HOWEVER, this can be a lot of data after many jobs are inspected!

To only back up the program, copy only the IRScan folder.

The two data folders can actually be located anywhere. Sometimes, the Backup folder is stored on a separate drive for better reliability.

If the data folders are moved, then the "Main Static Settings.ini" file in the IRScan folder must be updated. There are two entries related to this:

Primary Data Path=..\IR Scan Data Files -  Primary\
Backup Data Path=..\IR Scan Data Files - Backup\

Note that there may be sample entries preceded by a semi-colon -- these are ignored by the program as a semi-colon specifies that the line is merely a comment. The entries which are NOT preceded by semi-colons are the entries which must be modified.
