
When the DAc is on, any signal not covered by a gate is set to 38.0 dB.


Any signal covered by a gate has a gain equal to the Gain setting on
the Signal tab scaled by the height of the DAC gate:


	gate at 50% - gain equals Signal Tab Gain

	For every increment the gate is raised above 50%,
	the gain is increased by 0.11428571428571428 dB.

	For every increment the gate is lowered below 50%,
	the gain is decreased by 0.11428571428571428 dB.

	If the gate is set to the top of the screen, the gain for
	that gated area is Signal Tab Gain + 20dB.

	If the gate is set to the bottom of the screen, the gain for
	that gated area is Signal Tab Gain - 20dB.


Technical Note:

The actual decimal multiplier value for no software gain modification
is 512.  The value of 38.0 dB is equivalant to a decimal value of 514
which is the closest value which can be obtained with the resolution
of 0.1 dB allowed for user entry.
