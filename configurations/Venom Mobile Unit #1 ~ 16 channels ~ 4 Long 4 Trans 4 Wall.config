;Each transducer has its own trace so they can be offset based on their
;physical location in the system, but all leading ducers use the same color and all
;trailing ducers use the same color so it looks like only two traces.  Thus only two
;trace key names need to be displayed.  The key tags for the remaining traces are not
;displayed by setting their key labels to "<not visible>" in this file.

; 4 plotters are used: 2 for leading ducers and 2 for trailing ducers
