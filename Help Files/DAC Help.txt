DAC Help
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

When the DAC is on, any signal not covered by a gate is set to 38.0 dB.


Any signal covered by a gate has a gain equal to the Gain setting on
the Signal tab scaled by the height of the DAC gate:


	gate at 50% - gain equals Signal Tab Gain

	For every increment the gate is raised above 50%,
	the gain is increased by 0.11428571428571428 dB.

	For every increment the gate is lowered below 50%,
	the gain is decreased by 0.11428571428571428 dB.

	If the gate is set to the top of the screen, the gain for
	that gated area is Signal Tab Gain + 20dB.

	If the gate is set to the bottom of the screen, the gain for
	that gated area is Signal Tab Gain - 20dB.


Technical Note:

The actual decimal multiplier value for no software gain modification
is 512.  The value of 38.0 dB is equivalant to a decimal value of 514
which is the closest value which can be obtained with the resolution
of 0.1 dB allowed for user entry.


-- When the DAC Seems to Have no Effect --

This is most commonly seen on channels with an Interface Gate.

If the signal in the Interface Gate does not break the threshold,
neither the Software Gain nor the DAC gain will applied. In such case,
adjusting the Software Gain or the DAC gate levels will have no
effect.

Sometimes, turning the Tracking on and off appears to affect this
operation. This is usually due to the position of the Interface Gate
being set different for the tracking vs non-tracking mode. The
positions are stored separately. Depending on the settings, turning
the tracking on or off may cause the Interface Gate to shift to a
place where the signal exceeds the gate, at which time the gains will
be applied. Conversely, when the tracking is set to the opposite
setting, the gate may shift to where the signal does not exceed the
gate's level and the gains will not be applied.
