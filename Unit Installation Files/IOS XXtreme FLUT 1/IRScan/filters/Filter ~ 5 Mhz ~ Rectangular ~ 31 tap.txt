FIR filter shift is applied to the output of each convolution. It is typically negative to scale the output down. FIR filter shift range: -16 ~ +15

The coefficient scaling value is multiplied by each coefficient to change the filter gain. Usually, it is less than 1 to reduce the gain.

MKS -- try .06 for similar gain to other filter program?
	or leave at 1 and increase shift -- more accurate?
