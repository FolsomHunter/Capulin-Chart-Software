 Inspection Control Commands to Host

   1 - no tube detected
   2 - leading vertical eye is on tube
   3 - head 1 lowered
   4 - head 2 lowered
   5 - head 1 raised
   6 - head 2 raised

   Each time the command changes to reflect a new action (such as
   head 1 lowering), it stays at that value until a new action occurs
   (such as head 2 lowering).

	When inspecting in direction away from home, typical sequence is:
   	1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1

	For direction towards home:
   	1, 2, 4, 3, 6, 5, 1

      Note: These assume that carriage is not reversed off the tube
      		or any action taken that causes the heads to be
            raised/lowered out of sequence. In those cases, the
            command sequence will vary accordingly.
